 usm.2.d:0 " The Republican National Convention is occuring. There are 3 canidates that have more support than the rest. The more left wing Liberal Republicans from the North support Thomas Dewey. He has ran 3 times for president, and hopes he can beat Barkley. The next Canidate is the Hero of D-Day, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He leads the Right wing faction of the party. Finally, there is Earl Warren, leader of the center wing of the Republicans. Who will win the heated election." 
 usm.3.d:0 " Culbert Olson, former governor of California, has decided to announce his canidacy for president under his newly formed National Progressive Party modeled after Theodore Roosevelts Bull Moose Party. As his running mate, Olson picked the very radical Henry A. Wallace, the former vice president. Many in the center believe that due to Olsons rapidly worsening health, that Wallace will be president soon. With that, they believe that Wallace will create a Far-Left Nation that is controlled by a Trade Union Congress."
 usm.4.d:0 " The Democratic National Convention is now in session. Now the party must choose who they want their leader to be in this election. First up is current Vice President Alben Barkley, head of the center wing of the Democrats, and a former senator from Kentucky. He is currently the front runner as he is supported by current president Harry S. Truman. The next Canidate is Adlai Stevenson, Governor of Illinois. He is leader of the farther left Democrats and is Barkleys strongest contender. Finally there is Hubert Humphrey, a Senator from Minnesota, and leader of the right leaning Democrats. Although he is the least supported, he could come out with a win. It's anyones game at this point."
 usm.5.d:0 " Strom Thurmond, the 103rd Governor of South Carolina, is running for president for a second time under the Dixiecrat Party, a split from the Democratic Party. Many knew he would run, but his running mate was always a mystery. It ended up being Fielding L. Wright, 50th Governor of Mississippi. Many also thought that Dixiecrat Congressional Leader Francis J. Underwood would be the choice, but they need him in congress."
 gen.1.d:0 " It's been almost 8 years since Project Valkyrie, and it's been some time since a new Government. After these 8 years, President Beck has announced that he is resigning. He stated how he has cherished his time as president, and hoped that the time of great promise after the Nazis will continue. Chancellor Goerdeler is the defacto new president, as thats what German law entails. However, Cheif of the OKW, Henning Von Tresckow, belives that the military needs to have continued control over the government to prevent the restoration of the Nazis. However, many fear that a Military Coup could bring instability to the young state, and could possibly result in a Nazi or Communist Coup. Now Beck must choose who to support, the Chancellor who wants to restore the promised elections, OR the military OKW who want to keep stability."
 gen.2.d:0 " The time for an election has come. There are 4 parties in this election, most of them, have a chance of winning. The farthest left is the SPD, who is currently lead by Kurt Schumacher. However, after his stroke in December, it may be time for him to leave. Then, the least likely to win, the FDP(Liberals). This party is led by Theodore Heuss, Political Journalist. Then there is the world famous CDU(conservative), formerly known as the Zentrum(Centre). This party is led by the leader of the german democratic resistance, Konrad Adenauer. Finally, there is the current party, the DNVP, led by Chancellor Goerdeler. Who will win? Only the people can decide."
